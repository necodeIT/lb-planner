"""
This script is responsible for constructing a comment for unit tests run by GitHub Actions.
The constructed comment, containing a summary of the test results, will be posted to the PR via GitHub Actions.

The script retrieves test result data from a specified URL and extracts a summary of these results.
It then formats this summary into a comment, appending the specific commit ID for which the tests were run.
The final comment is written to a specified file and can be used by GitHub Actions to post back to the PR.

Usage:
------
```bash
python construct_unit_test_comment.py [URL] [COMMIT_ID] [OUT_FILE]
```

Parameters:
- URL: The endpoint from which the test result data is to be fetched. This should be a URL to a JSON file containing the test results.
- COMMIT_ID: The unique identifier of the commit for which the test results are applicable.
- OUT_FILE: The file to which the constructed comment is to be written.

Example:
--------
```bash
python construct_unit_test_comment.py "http://example.com/test-results.json" "abcd1234" "comment.txt"
```
